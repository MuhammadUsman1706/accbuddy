                                like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those
                                rights.

                                These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any
                                legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that
                                relationship under these terms.

                                We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our
                                services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

                                terms will govern for that service.
                                If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not
                                affect any other terms.
                                If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we
                                don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we
                                may have, such as taking action in the future.
                                <br><br>
                                We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect
                                changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new
                                services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for
                                legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.
                                <br><br>
                                If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll
                                provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the
                                changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent
                                situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If
                                you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the
                                services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your
